# About this document

This document tabulates the ECTS workload of the Seminar + Course ('Ãœbung') _19442: R-Course and Seminar: Metagenomics + Community analysis_.

# General Info

One ECTS equals 30 hours of 'student' work. 19442 consists of a Seminar (2 ECTS) and a practical-course (3 ECTS).

# Tabulations

## Grand total

Total hours:
```{r, echo = F}
rbind(seminar, course) %>% 
  group_by(Type) %>%
  gt::gt() %>% 
   gt::grand_summary_rows(
   columns = "Time (h)",
   fns = list(
     Total = ~sum(., na.rm = TRUE))
   ) %>% 
  gt::tab_header(
   title = gt::md("Breakdown of hours"),
   subtitle = gt::md("Metagenomics course (19442)")) %>% 
   gt::tab_footnote(
    footnote = "FT = Face Time",
    locations = gt::cells_column_labels(columns = vars(Task)))
```
With 1 ECTS equalling 30 hours, this is worth 5 ECTS.

## Seminar

The seminar is divided into presentation, and paper discussion. There will be 10 presentations, that generally introduce a topic, and 10 seminars, where a paper is discussed. The presentations and discussion of papers may take place on different days.

```{r, echo = F}
seminar %>%
  group_by(Type) %>%
  gt::gt() %>% 
    gt::grand_summary_rows(
    columns = "Time (h)",
    fns = list(
      Total = ~sum(., na.rm = TRUE))
    ) %>%
  gt::tab_header(
    title = gt::md("Breakdown of hours for the Seminar"),
    subtitle = gt::md("Metagenomics course (19442)")
  )  %>% 
  gt::tab_footnote(
    footnote = "FT = Face Time",
    locations = gt::cells_column_labels(columns = vars(Task)))
```

With 1 ECTS equalling 30 hours, this is worth 2 ECTS.

## Course ETCS

Tabulation of hours for the practical:

```{r, echo = F}
course %>%
  group_by(Type) %>%
  gt::gt() %>% 
    gt::grand_summary_rows(
    columns = "Time (h)",
    fns = list(
      Total = ~sum(., na.rm = TRUE))
    ) %>%
  gt::tab_header(
    title = gt::md("Breakdown of hours for the Course"),
    subtitle = gt::md("Metagenomics course (19442)")
  )
```

With 1 ECTS equalling 30 hours, this is worth 3 ECTS.
