# This function creates two OTU level correlation networks, one for each treatment
# This function then overlays two correlation tables. 
# This function also filters based on r value and minimum counts.
# This function is very quick and dirty and not well documented.
# It is provided to the LMU Metagenomics course to streamline analysis.
